# My Shop
This is an online store.  
There is a list of all products.  
Products are divided into categories. You can display a list of products of each category separately.  
There is a search by product name.  
Items can be added to the shopping cart.  
If necessary, you can change the number of products or remove unnecessary products from the basket.  
After checking the basket, you need to fill out the form with the data for the order.  
At the end, the order is assigned a number and sent to the store administration.    

The site can be viewed and used in test mode on the service <b>heroku.com</b>

The site can be deployed via <b>Docker</b>.
To do this, you need to switch to the "docker" branch. [⚡<b>LINK</b>⚡](https://github.com/mixand/myshop/tree/docker)
